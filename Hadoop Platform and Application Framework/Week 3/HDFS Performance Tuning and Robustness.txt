Week 3 Quiz 2
HDFS Performance Tuning and Robustness

1. Name the configuration file which holds HDFS tuning parameters
A. hdfs-site.xml

2. Name the parameter that controls the replication factor in HDFS:
A. dfs.replication

3. Check answers that apply when replication is lowered
A. HDFS is less robust
   less likely make data local to more workers
   more space

4. Check answers that apply when NameNode fails to receive heartbeat from a DataNode
A. DataNode is marked dead
   No new I/O is sent to particular DataNode that missed heartbeat check
   Blocks below replication factor are re-replicated on other DataNodes

5. How is data corruption mitigated in HDFS
A. checksums are computed on file creation and stored in HDFS namespace for verification when data is retrieved.
